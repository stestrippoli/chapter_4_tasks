# NLP Tasks

Each folder in this repository represents a Natural Language Processing task. In order to test the models, simply insert your own OpenAI API key in place of the placeholder "YOUR_API_KEY."

The outputs of each task are saved in JSON files containing the request, context (if applicable), and output.
