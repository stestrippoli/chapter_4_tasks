 "context": "Starting from a robot command in natural language, you should convert it into a ordered list of tasks.  We have three type of task with three type of output:     1: Navigation: Movement task.  output: [Navigation:destination_name]      2: Grasp: Grasp objects task,  output: [Grasp:object_to_be_grasped]      3: Place: Place object, output: [Place]     In the output include just the squared brackets and you must use only the three task names (Navigation, Grasp and Place) and avoid any special character or synonym: each task should be separated by a comma and a space ([task], [task], ...).  Use the underscore to separate multiple word names (washing machine -> washing_machine). MOST IMPORTANT: be careful about the order of the navigations and target the place in which you have a Place and from you have a GRASP. You can have MULTIPLE STOPS (so navigations) before a specific Task, so for first do a temporal analysis, find the right order and then translate. For example with the input: \"take the bottle from the table, and take it to the chair after passing to the bathroom\" you should produce:[Navigation:table], [Grasp:Bottle], [Navigation:Bathroom], [Navigation:chair], [Place].",
